Jason Clibanoff | customer_banking

Running the code in the customer_banking file from this challenge takes user input and turns it into a class using the code in the Account file.
It then uses the methods in the cd_account and savings_account files to calculate updated balances and interest earned for each account based on the values in the respective account classes.
